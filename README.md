# Cruip Tutorials made with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the repository of Cruip's guides & tutorials for **Next.js**. Here you will find the code for all the components we have developed and will develop, made in **TypeScript**, and ready to be integrated into your projects.

If you're new to our articles, we recommend taking a look here: [Tailwind CSS Tutorials](https://cruip.com/tutorials/). If you're new to Cruip's ecosystem, learn more about our [Tailwind CSS templates](https://cruip.com/).

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel
